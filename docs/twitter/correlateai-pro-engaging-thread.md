## Visual Content Strategy

### Images/GIFs to Create:
1. **Hero GIF**: Quick demo of all three features (15-20 seconds)
2. **Chart Interaction GIF**: Zoom selection in action (5-8 seconds)  
3. **Export Demo**: Dropdown menu interaction (3-5 seconds)
4. **AI Discovery**: Filter and recommendation showcase (8-10 seconds)
5. **Before/After**: UI improvements comparison (static image)

### Video Hook Ideas:
- Screen recording of full workflow: Generate → Zoom → Export → Discover
- Split screen: "Old way" vs "CorrelateAI Pro way"
- Fast-paced feature montage with upbeat music
