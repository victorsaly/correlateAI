Hi [IT Contact],

To begin analysis, I need read-only access to these tables:

Priority 1 (this week):

- Products (active catalog)

Connection details needed:
- Database server:
- Database name:
- Username (read-only):
- Password:
- Connection type: [ ] Direct SQL [ ] VPN [ ] API [ ] CSV Export

Security: We'll only read data, never write. All data encrypted.

Can you provide access by [date]?

### **Day 5-6: Data Extraction** 📥

#### **Option A: If you get database access**
```bash
# Run extraction script
python scripts/client_db_connector.py

# This will create:
# - data/client/invoices_3years.csv
# - data/client/customers_all.csv  
# - data/client/products_active.csv
```

#### **Option B: If client provides CSV exports**
Ask client IT to run SQL export scripts (see `technical-erp-integration.md`)

**Data to Extract:**
1. **Invoices** (last 3 years) → ~50,000 rows
2. **Customers** (all) → ~5,000 rows
3. **Products** (active) → ~500 rows

---

### **Day 7: Initial Analysis** 🔬

**Run these quick correlations:**

1. **Monthly Revenue vs Customer Count**
   - Question: "Does more customers = more revenue?"
   - Expected: Strong correlation (0.7+)
   - ROI: Customer acquisition strategy

2. **Invoice Amount vs Payment Speed**
   - Question: "Do big invoices get paid faster or slower?"
   - Expected: Negative correlation (bigger = slower)
   - ROI: Cash flow optimization

3. **Revenue vs Season**
   - Question: "When do we make the most money?"
   - Expected: Q4 spike (for most businesses)
   - ROI: Staffing and inventory timing

4. **Customer Churn vs Contact Frequency**
   - Question: "Does more touchpoints = less churn?"
   - Expected: Negative correlation (more touch = less churn)
   - ROI: Customer retention program

5. **Win Rate vs Quote Response Time**
   - Question: "Do faster quotes win more?"
   - Expected: Strong negative (faster = higher win rate)
   - ROI: Sales process optimization

```markdown
# CorrelateAI Quick Wins Report

Found 5 high-impact correlations

**Recommendation**: Offer 2% early payment discount on invoices >$50K
**ROI Impact**: +$850K cash flow improvement, saves $64K in interest

### Key Finding #3: Seasonal Opportunity
**Correlation**: Q4 revenue is 34% higher than Q2 average
**Insight**: December accounts for 15% of annual revenue
**Recommendation**: Pre-position inventory in October, add temp staff
**ROI Impact**: +$1.8M revenue from better Q4 preparation

### CorrelateAI Investment: $36K/year
### ROI: 22,400% (224x return)

### Spurious Warnings (False Patterns)
⚠️ "March revenue spike" - This is NOT caused by marketing campaigns
    (Analysis shows it's seasonal industry trend, not your activities)
    
⚠️ "Salesperson A outperforms B" - Sample size too small (3 months data)
    (Need 12+ months before making compensation changes)

### Next Steps
1. Implement Finding #5 (quote speed) - Fastest ROI (30 days)
2. Launch Finding #4 (retention program) - Medium term (90 days)
3. Plan Finding #3 (Q4 prep) - Long term (180 days)
4. Monitor progress quarterly with CorrelateAI dashboard
