# CorrelateAI: IT Reseller Quick Start Guide

## 🎯 **Selling CorrelateAI in 5 Minutes**

### **Your 30-Second Pitch**
*"CorrelateAI helps your clients discover hidden patterns in their business data that drive revenue and reduce costs—without hiring expensive data scientists. Think: 'What if your sales team could predict which leads will close?' or 'What if you could spot supply chain issues 3 weeks before they happen?' We give you 30% recurring commissions, full demo support, and your clients love it because they see ROI in 90 days."*

## 📞 **Sales Conversation Framework**

### **Step 1: Qualify the Prospect (2 minutes)**

Ask these questions:
1. **"How many data sources does your team work with?"**
   - Looking for: Multiple systems (Excel, SQL, CRM, ERP)
   - Green flag: "Too many to count" or "Data is all over the place"

2. **"How do you currently connect data from different departments?"**
   - Looking for: Manual processes, spreadsheets, "We don't really"
   - Green flag: "Lots of manual work" or "IT pulls reports"

3. **"What would it be worth if you could predict [key metric] 30 days earlier?"**
   - Examples: Sales forecasts, inventory needs, customer churn, production delays
   - Green flag: Dollar amount mentioned or "That would be huge"

4. **"Have you considered hiring a data scientist or analyst?"**
   - Looking for: Cost concerns or "We looked but it's expensive"
   - Green flag: Interest but budget constraints

**Disqualify if:**
- Less than 10 employees
- Single data source only
- No pain around data/decisions
- Already have robust data science team

---

### **Step 2: Demo the "Wow" Moment (3 minutes)**

Use this demo flow:

#### **A. Show the Business Problem**
*"Let me show you something interesting. Here's sales data from a retail client..."*
- Load sample correlation: Sales vs Weather
- Point out: **"See this? 0.82 correlation between temperature and ice cream sales"**

#### **B. The Business Insight**
*"This tells them: When sunny weekend is forecasted, stock up 40% more. They increased margin by 12%."*
- Highlight the **ROI number**: "That's $47K extra profit on a $12K annual investment"

#### **C. The Protection Feature**
*"But here's the magic—CorrelateAI also PREVENTS costly mistakes..."*
- Show spurious detection: "This pattern LOOKS real but it's actually random"
- Point out: **"Imagine stocking inventory based on a false pattern. CorrelateAI stops that."**

#### **D. Make It About Them**
*"Now imagine this with YOUR data: [their key metric] correlated with [their pain point]"*
- Example: "Your customer churn rate + support ticket types + payment delays"
- Ask: **"What would you do differently if you knew this correlation?"**

---

### **Step 3: Handle Objections**

#### **Objection: "We already have Excel/Power BI"**
**Response:** 
*"Great tools! CorrelateAI is different—it doesn't just visualize, it DISCOVERS correlations you don't know to look for. Excel shows you what you ask for. CorrelateAI shows you what you didn't know to ask. Plus, it validates whether correlations are real or spurious—something Excel can't do."*

#### **Objection: "Our data is messy"**
**Response:**
*"Perfect! 90% of our clients say that. CorrelateAI works with CSV exports, direct database connections, and even API pulls. You don't need to clean data first—the system handles normalization. Let's start with ONE data source to prove value, then expand."*

#### **Objection: "We need IT approval"**
**Response:**
*"Smart—and that's easy here. CorrelateAI can deploy on-premise (your infrastructure), cloud, or hybrid. No data leaves your environment if you don't want it to. We're GDPR, HIPAA, and SOC 2 compliant. IT typically approves in 1-2 days because there's no security risk. Want me to send IT a technical brief?"*

#### **Objection: "What if it doesn't work for us?"**
**Response:**
*"That's why we do a 14-day free trial with your actual data. No credit card required. I'll personally work with you to connect one data source and generate 5 real insights. If you don't see value, no harm done. But 94% of trials convert because they see ROI immediately. Can we schedule a trial start date?"*

#### **Objection: "Too expensive"**
**Response:**
*"Let me ask: what does it cost when you make the WRONG decision because you didn't have this insight? One bad inventory buy? One missed sales opportunity? Clients typically find CorrelateAI pays for itself in the first month. Plus, compared to hiring a data analyst at $75K/year, CorrelateAI is 85% cheaper. Let's run an ROI calculator together—it takes 2 minutes."*
