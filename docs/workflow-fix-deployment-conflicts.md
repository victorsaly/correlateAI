# Workflow Fix: Preventing Deployment Conflicts

## Problem Summary

The automated data collection workflow was causing deployment conflicts and unnecessary builds:

### Issues Identified:

1. **No Branch Restriction**: The data collection workflow could run on any branch
2. **Triggering Unnecessary Deployments**: Every data update pushed to main triggered a full deployment rebuild
3. **No Branch Verification**: The workflow didn't verify it was running on the correct branch before pushing
4. **Deployment on Data-Only Changes**: The deploy workflow rebuilt the entire site even when only data files changed

## Root Cause

```
Automated Data Collection Workflow (weekly cron)
    ‚Üì
Commits data updates to current branch
    ‚Üì
Pushes to main branch
    ‚Üì
Triggers Deploy Workflow (on every push to main)
    ‚Üì
Full site rebuild and deployment
    ‚Üì
CONFLICT: If workflow runs on wrong branch or during active development
```

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. **Branch Restrictions on Data Collection** (`automated-data-collection.yml`)

```yaml
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 6 * * 1'  # Still runs weekly
  workflow_dispatch:
    # ... inputs ...
  push:
    branches:
      - main
    paths:
      - '.github/workflows/automated-data-collection.yml'
```

**Why**: Ensures the workflow only runs on main branch and when the workflow file itself changes.

### 2. **Branch Verification Step**

```yaml
- name: ‚úÖ Verify Branch
  run: |
    CURRENT_BRANCH=$(git branch --show-current)
    if [ "$CURRENT_BRANCH" != "main" ]; then
      echo "‚ùå Error: This workflow must run on main branch"
      exit 1
    fi
    echo "‚úÖ Confirmed running on main branch"
```

**Why**: Adds a safety check to fail fast if the workflow somehow runs on the wrong branch.

### 3. **Skip CI in Commit Messages**

```yaml
git commit -m "ü§ñ Automated data update - $TIMESTAMP [skip ci]
```

**Why**: The `[skip ci]` tag tells GitHub Actions to skip running workflows on this commit, preventing recursive workflow triggers.

### 4. **Explicit Branch Push**

```yaml
git push origin main
```

**Why**: Explicitly pushes to the main branch instead of using `git push` which pushes to the current branch.

### 5. **Path Ignore in Deploy Workflow** (`deploy.yml`)

```yaml
on:
  push:
    branches: ["main"]
    paths-ignore:
      - 'public/ai-data/**'
      - 'data-summary.md'
      - '**.md'
      - 'docs/**'
  workflow_dispatch:
```

**Why**: The deployment workflow now ignores changes to:
- Data files in `public/ai-data/`
- Documentation files (`.md`)
- The `data-summary.md` file
- Documentation folder

This prevents unnecessary deployments when only data updates occur.

## Benefits

‚úÖ **Prevents Deployment Conflicts**: Data updates no longer trigger full site rebuilds  
‚úÖ **Saves Build Minutes**: Automated data updates don't consume GitHub Actions minutes for deployments  
‚úÖ **Clearer Separation**: Data collection and deployment are now independent processes  
‚úÖ **Safer Operations**: Branch verification prevents accidental pushes to wrong branches  
‚úÖ **Faster Data Updates**: Data can be updated without waiting for a full deployment cycle  

## Workflow Behavior Now

### Data Collection (Weekly or Manual)
```
Monday 6 AM UTC (or manual trigger)
    ‚Üì
Verify running on main branch
    ‚Üì
Collect data from 13+ sources
    ‚Üì
Commit with [skip ci] tag
    ‚Üì
Push to main branch
    ‚Üì
‚úÖ Data updated, NO deployment triggered
```

### Deployment (Code Changes Only)
```
Push code changes to main
    ‚Üì
Check if code files changed (not just data)
    ‚Üì
If YES: Trigger deployment
If NO: Skip deployment
    ‚Üì
‚úÖ Only deploys when necessary
```

## Testing the Fix

### Test Data Collection Without Deployment:
```bash
# Manually trigger data collection
gh workflow run automated-data-collection.yml

# Verify no deployment was triggered
gh run list --workflow=deploy.yml --limit 5
```

### Test Deployment Still Works:
```bash
# Make a code change
git commit -m "Update component"
git push origin main

# Verify deployment is triggered
gh run list --workflow=deploy.yml --limit 1
```

## Monitoring

Check workflow status:
```bash
# Check recent data collection runs
gh run list --workflow=automated-data-collection.yml --limit 5

# Check recent deployments
gh run list --workflow=deploy.yml --limit 5

# View specific run logs
gh run view <run-id> --log
```

## Future Improvements

Consider implementing:

1. **Separate Data Branch**: Use a `data` branch for updates, then PR to main
2. **Conditional Deployment**: Only deploy if data changes AND it's a specific day/time
3. **Manual Approval**: Require manual approval for deployments after data updates
4. **Staging Environment**: Test data updates in staging before production
