## üìä Quantum Metrics Explained

### Core Quantum Metrics
- **Quantum Confidence (0-100%)**: Multi-factor confidence score combining sample size, correlation strength, and temporal stability
- **Entanglement Strength (0-1)**: Measures phase correlation patterns in the data
- **Coherence Score (0-1)**: Local data consistency and pattern alignment
- **Quantum Significance (0-100%)**: Enhanced significance incorporating uncertainty principles

### Quantum State Analysis
- **Phase**: Trend-based phase relationships between variables
- **Amplitude**: Quantum weight distribution strength
- **Interference**: Pattern interference in temporal data
- **Superposition**: Entropy-based measure of state distribution

### Data Quality Metrics
- **Data Quality (0-100%)**: Composite score of completeness, stability, and noise
- **Temporal Stability (0-100%)**: Consistency of trends over time
- **Noise Level (0-1)**: Signal-to-noise ratio assessment

## üî¨ Example: GDP Growth ‚Üî Temperature

The quantum analysis provides a realistic example showing:

```
GDP Growth ‚Üî Temperature
Positive correlation detected

Strong Correlation: 0.730
Significance: 92.0%
Quantum Confidence: 85.0%
```

This demonstrates how economic growth patterns can correlate with climate indicators when analyzed through quantum-inspired algorithms that account for:
- Temporal dependencies
- Phase relationships
- Data coherence
- Multi-factor confidence assessment
